"# Multimodal Fusion with Attention Mechanisms" 
"" 
"This repository hosts research and implementations aimed at fusing information from multiple modalities (like text, audio, and visual data) to enhance machine learning models. By utilizing state-of-the-art attention mechanisms, we aim to address the challenges in Multimodal Fusion to build more robust, versatile, and accurate systems."
