# Multimodal Fusion with Attention Mechanisms

This repository hosts research and implementations aimed at fusing information from multiple modalities (like text, audio, and visual data) to enhance machine learning models. By utilizing state-of-the-art attention mechanisms, we aim to address the challenges in Multimodal Fusion and build more robust, versatile, and accurate systems.
